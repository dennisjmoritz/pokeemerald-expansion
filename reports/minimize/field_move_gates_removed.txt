Field Move Badge Gates Removed
===============================

All HM field moves are now accessible based solely on Pokemon knowledge, not badge requirements.

Modified Functions in src/field_move.c:
- IsFieldMoveUnlocked_Cut() - Badge 1 requirement removed
- IsFieldMoveUnlocked_Flash() - Badge 2 requirement removed  
- IsFieldMoveUnlocked_RockSmash() - Badge 3 requirement removed
- IsFieldMoveUnlocked_Strength() - Badge 4 requirement removed
- IsFieldMoveUnlocked_Surf() - Badge 5 requirement removed
- IsFieldMoveUnlocked_Fly() - Badge 6 requirement removed
- IsFieldMoveUnlocked_Dive() - Badge 7 requirement removed
- IsFieldMoveUnlocked_Waterfall() - Badge 8 requirement removed

All functions now return TRUE instead of checking FLAG_BADGE##_GET flags.

Impact:
- Players can use HM moves as soon as they teach them to Pokemon
- No need to progress through gym badge storyline to access field moves
- Significantly reduces story gating and improves game flow
- Maintains balance by still requiring Pokemon to know the specific move
