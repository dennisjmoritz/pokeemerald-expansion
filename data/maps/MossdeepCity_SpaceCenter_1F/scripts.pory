That's successful launch no. {STR_VAR_1}!$ A rocket launch demands perfection. Not even a 1% margin of error is allowed.\p Even if it's 99% okay, the whole thing is useless if 1% happens to be no good.\p Despite that, we never stop trying. Why? It's a dream that never ends.$ Those MAGMA thugs have their sights set on our SPACE CENTER.\p But we can't allow anything that minor to interfere with our rocket launch!$ I was taking a stroll down the beach when I found this.\p It's not anything I need, so you can have it.$ The HOENN region has been famous for its meteor showers for a long time.$ TEAM MAGMA can't be allowed to steal the rocket fuel.\p Oh, by the way, you can have this stone I found on the beach.$ With TEAM MAGMA around, I guess strolls on the beach aren't safe.$ Some people claim that POKéMON came from space. Could it be true?$ TEAM AQUA should take care of TEAM MAGMA!\p But if they did that, TEAM AQUA will become bold and brazen, won't they?$ A giant chunk of metal bursts through the skies and flies into space…\p It boggles my mind!$ A giant chunk of metal bursts through the skies and flies into space…\p But TEAM MAGMA wants to spoil that dream of mine!\p I'm not having any of that!$ STEVEN: {PLAYER}{KUN}, have you read that proclamation already?\p TEAM MAGMA is coming after the rocket fuel on this island.\p I don't know what they'd need it for, but they can't be allowed to take it.\p I'll keep an eye on things for a while longer.\p In the meantime, why don't you go check out the town?$ As promised, we've come for the rocket fuel!$ Ran out of fuel…$ Don't think you're on a roll just because you've beaten me!$ We gave you fair warning! There's nothing sneaky about us!$ Grrr… We should've used sneaky treachery…$ Okay, I get it already! The next time, we'll come unannounced.$ The rocket fuel the SPACE CENTER has in storage--that's what we're after.\p We mean to take every last bit of it!$ Please, can you spare some fuel? Even a chintzy cup will do!$ What are we going to do with the rocket fuel?\p How would I know? Ask our leader upstairs!$ Our leader said no one, but no one, gets past me!$ Ack! Ack! Aaack!$ Please, tell our leader that I never abandoned my post.\l That I stayed to the bitter end…$ This is… An intent-to-steal notice?\p “To the staff of the SPACE CENTER: How are you? We are doing fine.\p “We will soon visit you to take your rocket fuel.\p “Please don't try to stop us. We will take the fuel no matter what.\p “Let there be more land! TEAM MAGMA”")
