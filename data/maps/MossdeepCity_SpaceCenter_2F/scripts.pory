    format("MOSSDEEP has mainly sunny weather, and its winds are stable.\p It's an ideal location for launching rockets.$ Why would TEAM MAGMA want to steal our rocket fuel in the first place?$ If only I was a little younger, I would have liked being an astronaut…\p No… It's not too late! I can and will try!$ If TEAM MAGMA takes the rocket fuel, I won't be able to go to space!\p They can't be allowed to get away with such an outrage!$ I wish ordinary people could go into space one day…$ TEAM MAGMA… Do they want to go to space, too?$ What's wrong with you?\p You're outnumbered three to one, but you still want to take us on?$ Good answer! That's what a smart person'll do!$ A reckless go-getter, are you? Okay, I'll go first!$ I lost! But!$ It's too soon to be relieved! I'm up next!$ I lost, too! But!$ I bet you want to take a break. But I'm not about to let you do that!$ We should've taken a break… That's what we should've done…$ Three of us here, and look at the sorry mess we got ourselves into.$ We three losing like this… We look worse than usual by triple!$ Are we being useful to our leader at all?$ Hehehe!\p We come all the way here to get some fuel, and we're interfered with again!\p If you're going to mess with us too, we'll take care of you at the same time!$ MAXIE: Clear out of the way! Don't you dare interfere!$ STEVEN: TEAM MAGMA…\p What's the point of stealing rocket fuel?$ MAXIE: Fufufu… Since you're so curious, you deserve an explanation.\p We're going to jettison the entire load into MT. CHIMNEY!\p With GROUDON gone, we have no need for that slag heap of a mountain!\p So we'll use the fuel's power to make the volcano erupt!\p It will be savage!$ STEVEN: {PLAYER}{KUN}! You're going to help me?\p Let's go into battle together! Are you ready?$ STEVEN: Then, hurry! Get ready quickly!$ All I want… I just want to expand the land mass…$ I'm with our leader…$ MAXIE: We failed to make the volcano erupt…\p We failed to control GROUDON after we had awoken it…\p Is our goal to expand the land misguided?\p … … … … … … … … … … … …\p If… If we, TEAM MAGMA, are wrong…\l … … … … … …\p Then might TEAM AQUA's goal to expand the sea also be equally misguided?$ MAXIE: All right… We will give up on the fuel…\p There appear to be more important matters that I must examine…$ STEVEN: Whew, that was too tense. {PLAYER}{KUN}, thank you.\p I have something to give you as thanks for your support.\p Please come see me at home after this.\p Oh, yes, I don't live in RUSTBORO CITY. I live right here on this island.")
