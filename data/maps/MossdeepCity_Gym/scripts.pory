Go for it!$ Wow, you're astounding! You're one great TRAINER!$ Battles hinge on the strength of your spirit! The weak-spirited will never win!$ I lost! I must temper my spirit again!$ The indecisive lose.

But this dust bunny…\p Whoooooooooooooooh! … … … … … …\p No, I'm not cheating! I didn't blow on it! Honestly!$ When you lose to me, don't be too hard on yourself.\p It's not that you're weak--I'm just too strong!$ You're just too strong!$ I'm not going to get down on myself for losing.

My, my! Your battle style is fantastic!$ I… I don't let defeat rattle m-me, however b-badly.$ Let me show you a perfectly awful, horrifying time!$ N-nooooo!$ Your vitality is contagious! Get away from me quickly!$ I may be past my prime, but I suggest you not patronize me.$ Ah, you overflow with the power of youth!$ It seems that I could not overcome your youthful energy.$ You're not getting through to the end! Not if I can help it!$ How could you be so ludicrously strong?$ Humph! You may be strong, but you're not suitable for the PSYCHIC type!\p The way you battle is somehow brutal!$ Wroooar! Have a taste of my super POKéMON hard-battling power!$ Oh! Done in!$ All right! I think I'll develop a special invincible POKéMON power next.$ TATE: Hehehe… Were you surprised?\p LIZA: Fufufu… Were you surprised?\p TATE: That there are two GYM LEADERS?
