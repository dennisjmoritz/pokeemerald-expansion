    format("I'm the GAME DESIGNER.\p Oh, is that right? You're working on a POKéDEX?\p It's tough trying to complete it, but don't give up.\p If you do complete it, please come show me.$ Wow! That's awesome! Yep, it's totally awesome!\p This POKéDEX is completely filled! You really must love POKéMON!\p I'm so impressed!\p Let me give you something in recognition of your feat!$ Me? You're talking to me? I'm the PROGRAMMER.\p I wonder what the SLOTS are like here.$ I'm the GRAPHIC ARTIST! Aren't the POKéMON of HOENN interesting?$ The girl TUBERS, they're cute, hey? To battle against a cute TUBER…\p Whoop, it's so awesome!\p And the TWINS! Aren't they cute? A 2-on-2 battle with TWINS…\p Whoop, it's unbearably fun!$ The sea breeze tickles my heart. It feels wonderful here!$ You never know when and where people will challenge you.\p That's why I never leave home without my GAME BOY ADVANCE.$ SCOTT: … … … … … … … … … … Zzz…\p … … … … … Huh?! Oh, sorry, sorry! I was snoozing!\p I came to check out this POKéMON CONTEST thing.\p I have to admit, it does look quite entertaining, but…\p Consider me a purist--I prefer battles and tough TRAINERS.\p But that's just me.\p {PLAYER}{KUN}, I hope you'll enjoy everything like the GYMS, CONTESTS, BATTLE TENT,\l the whole works!$ SCOTT: I think it does take strategy to win a CONTEST.\p Devising CONTEST strategies is one way of becoming a better TRAINER, I'd say.")
