Hi!\p We have a {STR_VAR_1} about the same age as you.\p Our {STR_VAR_1} was excited about making a new friend.\p Our {STR_VAR_1} is upstairs, I think.$ Like child, like father.\p My husband is as wild about POKéMON as our child.\p If he's not at his LAB, he's likely scrabbling about in grassy places.$ That {RIVAL}!\p I guess our child is too busy with POKéMON to notice that you came\l to visit, {PLAYER}{KUN}.$ Oh, {RIVAL} went out to ROUTE 103 just a little while ago.\p Like father, like child. {RIVAL} can't stay quietly at home.$ I think it's wonderful for people to travel with POKéMON.\p But you should go home every so often to let your mother know you're okay.\p She might not say it, but I'm sure she worries about you, {PLAYER}{KUN}.$ Huh? Who… Who are you?\p … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … …\p Oh, you're {PLAYER}{KUN}. So your move was today.\p Um… I'm MAY. Glad to meet you!\p I… I have this dream of becoming friends\l with POKéMON all over the world.\p I… I heard about you, {PLAYER}{KUN}, from my dad, PROF. BIRCH.\p I was hoping that you would be nice, {PLAYER}{KUN}, and that we could be friends.\p Oh, this is silly, isn't it? I… I've just met you, {PLAYER}{KUN}.\p Eheheh…\p Oh, no! I forgot!\p I was supposed to go help Dad catch some wild POKéMON!\p {PLAYER}{KUN}, I'll catch you later!$ Hey! You…\p Who are you?\p Oh, you're {PLAYER}, aren't you? Moved in next door, right?\p I didn't know that you're a girl.\p Dad, PROF. BIRCH, said that our new next-door neighbor is a GYM LEADER's\l kid, so I assumed you'd be a guy.\p My name's BRENDAN. So, hi, neighbor!\p Huh? Hey, {PLAYER}, don't you have a POKéMON?\p Do you want me to go catch you one?\p Aw, darn, I forgot…\p I'm supposed to go help my dad catch some wild POKéMON.\p Some other time, okay?$ Hi, neighbor!\p Do you already have your own POKéMON?")
