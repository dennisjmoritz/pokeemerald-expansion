    format("MT. CHIMNEY's JAGGED PASS…\p Now this is what I've always wanted in a mountain.\p This jagged bumpiness… It rocks my soul!$ Losing left me bitter!$ Yes, I did lose at POKéMON…\p But, when it comes to the love of the mountains, I have you beat!$ This place isn't your casual hike. It's not suited for a picnic.$ Ohhh, no! The ground is too bumpy…$ Did you know?\p Some people cleverly ride their bicycles up this horribly bumpy pass.$ Will you ever be back in this area? If you do return, I'd like a rematch.$ Picnics are fun wherever you go. Just like POKéMON!$ I only lost because the ground is too bumpy!$ I'll forget about losing and just enjoy this bumpy hike.$ JAGGED PASS is hard to walk on. It's a good place for training.$ It was all over while we were still trying to find a good footing…$ If I had an ACRO BIKE, I'd be able to jump ledges.$ When I get more used to this bumpiness, I'll be sure to win!\p Can you register me in your POKéNAV?$ I got used to this bumpiness. I sing while I climb now.$ It's still not easy to battle on this bumpy ground…$ I should get an ACRO BIKE from RYDEL in MAUVILLE CITY…$ Wah! What are you doing here?\p What am I doing in a place like this?\p What business is it of yours?$ Urrrgh…\p I should've ducked into our HIDEOUT right away…$ Okay, oh-kay! I admit it--you're strong!\p Don't worry about me. Go wherever you want!$ Oh! This boulder is shaking in response to the MAGMA EMBLEM!$ Aiyeeh! It's awfully scary to shoot down the mountain in one go!$ I feel like I'm falling apart…$ My bicycle bounced around so much, my rear end's sore…$ I climb this hill every day. I have confidence in my strength!$ Hmm… What went wrong?$ What is that odd rock protrusion a little up the hill from here?")
