I can see that you're a TRAINER.\p So that means you use the POKéMON Storage System I developed.\p How I arrived at that conclusion is a simple deductive process.\p You spoke to me because you wanted to access something on this PC.\p Oh, I'm sorry. I'm LANETTE.\p Honestly, I'm glad to meet you--it's great you're using the Storage System.\p If you could, please visit me at home. My house is on ROUTE 114.$ I wonder what POKéMON looked like long, long ago?\p Maybe the FOSSIL MANIAC at the edge of town will know.$ In the fields of FALLARBOR, we plant seedlings of hardy trees that thrive\l even in volcanic ash.")
