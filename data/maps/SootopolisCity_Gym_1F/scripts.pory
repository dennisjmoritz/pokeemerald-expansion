    format("Yo! How's it going, CHAMPION- bound {PLAYER}?\p SOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER JUAN is a master of WATER-type POKéMON.\p And, to get to JUAN, an icy floor will hamper your progress…\p Listen, I'm sorry, but that's all the advice that I have for you.\p The rest of the way, you have to go for it yourself!$ Yow! You've beaten even JUAN, who was supposedly the best in all HOENN!\p Okay! Check out your TRAINER CARD.\p If you've gotten all the BADGES, you're set for the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge!$ Let me ask you. Did you know?\l Ah, I should not be so coy.\p It was I who taught WALLACE everything there is to know about POKéMON.\p Once, I had given up my position as the GYM LEADER.\p In my place, I had entrusted WALLACE with the GYM.\p However, a compelling reason arose for me to make a comeback.\p Ah, but enough chatter. Let us begin our match, shall we?\p Please, you shall bear witness to our artistry.\p A grand illusion of water sculpted by POKéMON and myself!$ Ahahaha, excellent! Very well, you are the winner.\p From you, I sense the brilliant shine of skill that will overcome all.\p However, compared with me or even WALLACE, you are lacking in elegance.\p Perhaps I should make you a loan of my outfit?\p … … … … … … … … … … … …\p Hahaha, I merely jest!\p Rather than my clothes, I shall reward you with this, the RAIN BADGE!$ {PLAYER} received the RAIN BADGE from JUAN.$ Having the RAIN BADGE shall assure you the full obedience of all your POKéMON\l to your every command.\p The RAIN BADGE also allows the use of the HM move WATERFALL to scale\l walls of cascading water.\p And, so that you never forget the battle we shared, take this…$ The TECHNICAL MACHINE I handed you contains WATER PULSE.\p In use, it will occasionally confuse the target with ultrasonic waves.\p … … … … … …$ Registered GYM LEADER JUAN in the POKéNAV.$ The TRAINERS who have gathered all the GYM BADGES of HOENN should make\l way to the ultimate destination.\p The POKéMON LEAGUE.\p Travel to the easternmost reaches of HOENN, to the island EVER GRANDE.\p There, you shall find the POKéMON LEAGUE.$ There remains but one BADGE to obtain in HOENN.\p If you wish to challenge the POKéMON LEAGUE, you must obtain the last\l BADGE from the GYM in FORTREE.$ SOOTOPOLIS CITY POKéMON GYM$ SOOTOPOLIS CITY POKéMON GYM\p JUAN'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS: {PLAYER}$ JUAN: Ah, this GYM had returned to its usual state of serenity…\p But our young typhoon has returned to put us to the test again!\p Well, my friend, most certainly!\p I shall be delighted to dance with you as often as you wish!$ Ahahaha, you are the winner! You have defeated me again!$ JUAN: If I told you to become my apprentice, you will refuse, I am sure.\p I would like to make a gift of my coat to you.\p But again, you will refuse. I imagine that to be so.\p And that, my friend, is a certain sign of nobility!$ JUAN: Ah, this GYM had returned to its usual state of serenity…\p But our young typhoon has returned to put us to the test again!\p Well, my friend, most certainly! I shall be delighted to dance with you…\p Ah, no, no, no. You have with you but one POKéMON.\p I wish that you would return with two, perhaps more, POKéMON, please.")
