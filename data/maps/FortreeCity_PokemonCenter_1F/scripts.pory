It mixes and matches the records of TRAINERS.\p I don't know quite how it works, but it's cool. It's exciting, even!$ Oh, wow, you have a POKéNAV! And it's just like mine!\p Do you know about POKéNAV's MATCH CALL system?\p Access it, and you can chat with registered TRAINERS anytime.\p It also shows you which TRAINERS want a rematch with you.\p It's really nifty! Those DEVON guys sure know what they're doing!")
