    format("WALLY: I lost to you, {PLAYER}, but I'm not feeling down anymore.\p Because I have a new purpose in life. Together with my RALTS, I'm going\l to challenge POKéMON GYMS and become\l a great TRAINER.\p Please watch me, {PLAYER}. I'm going to be stronger than you.\p When I do, I'm going to challenge you to another battle.$ WALLY: Please watch me, {PLAYER}. I'm going to get stronger than you.\p When I do, I'm going to challenge you to another battle.$ UNCLE: Oh! {PLAYER}{KUN}! WALLY's next door.\p But, boy, there's something I have to tell you.\p This natural environment is doing wonders for WALLY's health.\p Maybe it's not just the environment. It could be POKéMON that are giving\l the boy hope.$ WALLY's gone away… He slipped off on his own…$ UNCLE: Is that right? WALLY's gone away that far all by\l himself…\p Well, I have to give him credit--he is my little brother's son.$ WANDA: You are? Oh, right, I get it!\p You're the {PLAYER} who WALLY was telling me about.\p I'm WALLY's cousin. Glad to meet you!\p I think WALLY's become a lot more lively and healthy since he came here.$ WANDA: Don't worry about WALLY. He'll be just fine.\p I know my little cousin, and he has POKéMON with him, too.$ Thanks to you, I can see my girlfriend every day.\l Happy? You bet I am!$ My daughter's boyfriend is a very driven and passionate sort of person.\p He's been digging a tunnel nonstop just so he can see my daughter.\p My daughter's a little concerned, so she goes out to the tunnel a lot.$ It's amazing. My daughter's boyfriend was digging the tunnel by hand!\p It's so incredible!$ If anything were to happen to WALLY, I would never be able to look his\l parents in PETALBURG in the eye…$ WALLY was in EVER GRANDE?\p His parents in PETALBURG would be astonished to hear that!")
