    format("We're developing a device for talking with POKéMON.\p But we haven't had much success…$ I'm developing new kinds of POKé BALLS…\p But I haven't made much headway…$ We finally made new kinds of POKé BALLS!\p The REPEAT BALL makes it easier to catch POKéMON you've caught before.\p The TIMER BALL gets better at catching POKéMON the longer a battle runs.\p Both are proudly developed by the DEVON CORPORATION.\p Please give them a try!$ I made the POKéNAV!\p As an engineer, I feel blessed to have made something so great!$ Oh, wow! That's a POKéNAV!\p It came about as a result of our PRESIDENT's desire to learn about\l the feelings of POKéMON.\p Would you like me to describe its features in detail?\p No, no. I think you'll find out just by trying the POKéNAV out.$ I'm trying to develop a device that visually reproduces the dreams of\l POKéMON…\p But it's not going well.$ I've been trying to develop a device that resurrects POKéMON from fossils…\p And, it's working!$ Wait! That thing you have there… Is that a POKéMON fossil?\p Would you like to bring that POKéMON back to life?\p I can with my newly developed FOSSIL REGENERATOR.$ Oh, is that so?\p DEVON's technological expertise is outstanding, I tell you.$ Oh, now that's a surprise! You have not one, but two, fossils?\p Unfortunately, my machine can only regenerate one POKéMON at a time.\p Would you like to pick one of your fossils for regeneration?$ Excellent! Let's do this right away.\p {PLAYER} handed the {STR_VAR_1} to the DEVON RESEARCHER.$ The FOSSIL REGENERATOR, which I made, is incredible.\p But it has one drawback--it takes a long time to work.\p So, uh… How about you go for a stroll and look around for a while?$ Thanks for waiting!\p Your fossilized POKéMON has been brought back to life!\p The fossil was an ancient POKéMON. {STR_VAR_2}, it was!$ {PLAYER} received {STR_VAR_2} from the DEVON RESEARCHER.$ Uh-oh, you've got too many POKéMON. You have no room for this one.$ I'm trying to develop a new feature for the POKéNAV…\p But it's not going well.$ Well, now what shall I work on developing next?\p Our company allows us to make our inspirations into reality.\p One couldn't ask for a better environment as an engineer.")
