STERN on the ocean floor exploration.\p But the sub's too small for me.\p If I squeezed in, there wouldn't be any room for the CAPTAIN…$ CAPT.

It's useless to you, {PLAYER}{KUN}…\p Well, okay, then. If you want to trade your SCANNER, let me know.$ CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for my DEEPSEATOOTH?$ CAPT.
