Hehehe!$ Wahahah, I grew weary of waiting! You owe me a battle, too!$ Tired of waiting… Lost and dazed…$ BOSS… Is this good enough?$ Warp panels, the HIDEOUT's pride and joy!\p You're clueless about where you are, aren't you?\p Fluster and tire out the enemy, then lower the boom! That's our plan!$ What's wrong with you? You're not tired at all!$ That reminds me… I can't remember where I put the MASTER BALL.\p If I fail to guard it, our BOSS will chew me out…$ When I joined TEAM AQUA, the first thing I had to learn was how these\l warp panels connected.$ I was too occupied thinking about the warp panels…$ I'll have to learn about how I can battle more effectively…")
