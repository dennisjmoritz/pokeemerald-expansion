Would you like some?$ Thank you very much! Here are your COINS!$ Um… You don't appear to have enough money…$ Oh? Your COIN CASE is full.$ Oh… You don't need COINS, then? Good luck on your adventure!$ Welcome.\p You can exchange your COINS for prizes here.$ Which prize would you like?$ So your choice is the {STR_VAR_1} {STR_VAR_2}?$ Thank you! We'll send it to your PC at home.$ You don't have enough COINS.$ There isn't any room available for placing {STR_VAR_1}.$ Oh, is that so? You need to save some COINS before\l coming back here.$ So your choice is {STR_VAR_1}?$ Here you go!$ Oh, you can't carry any more than that.$ I made a mistake and got two of the same DOLLS.\p Would you like one of them?$ Here you go!$ Huh? You want it, but not right now?$ Oh, don't be so negative! You can have this!$ There's a prize I want, but I can't win the jackpot.$ Hey, kid, if you want to play here, you need a COIN CASE.\p I think the young lady next door had one. Go see her!$ My luck can only last so long. This is too much for me.\l Here, take some COINS!$ MAUVILLE has something for everyone.\p For me, it's the GAME CORNER.$ The ROULETTE tables have different rates.\p Check your COINS if you're going to pick a table.$ It's easy to lose track of time in here. I should get back to work.$ COINS are needed to play here in the GAME CORNER.$ This ROULETTE thing… It's rather demanding.\p Win or lose, it's only by luck.$ Up to three COINS can be used to play the SLOTS.$ It's very difficult to make it stop right on “7.”\p If it stops on “7” during the REEL TIME bonus game, you'll receive extra COINS.$ Here's some information for you about the SLOTS.\p The more lightning bolts you stock, the more REEL TIME chances you get.\p In a game with the maximum five REEL TIME chances…\p It is possible to receive four regular bonuses, then a big bonus.\p That would total 660 COINS, but it's very difficult to get.$ You can't play if you don't have a COIN CASE.")
