    format("Yo, how's it going?\p Listen, my friend! Would you like to become the CHAMPION?\p I'm no TRAINER, not me, but I can sure give you winning advice.\p That's settled, then! We'll aim for the POKéMON CHAMPIONSHIP together!\p It's your job as a TRAINER to collect GYM BADGES, am I right?\p But GYM LEADERS aren't pushovers!\p And that's where I come in! I'm here to provide expert advice!\p ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, is a user of ROCK-type POKéMON.\p The ROCK type is very durable, but it can't stand WATER-type and\l GRASS-type moves.\p Come see me afterwards, if you beat the GYM LEADER.\p Well, go for it!$ Whoa! What a breathtaking victory! My cheering must've worked!\p Great! Check your TRAINER CARD.\p The STONE BADGE you got should be properly recorded on it.\p In other words…\p You've climbed the first step on the stairs to the CHAMPIONSHIP!\p That's got to feel awesome!$ Don't take us GYM TRAINERS lightly! I'll show you why we're better!$ You were too good for me…$ You haven't seen anything of the ROCK type's terrifying power!$ If you can't beat me, you won't stand a chance against ROXANNE!$ Wow! You've got some potential!$ ROXANNE is stronger than me by several times.\p You'd better be on your guard!$ We might be in the middle of town, but so what?\p My ROCK POKéMON need room to rampage!$ Oh, man oh man! Our challenger is one feisty customer!$ I have to hand it to our LEADER.\p It took smarts and sense for her to pick the ROCK type at her young age.$ Hello, I am ROXANNE, the RUSTBORO POKéMON GYM LEADER.\p I became a GYM LEADER so that I might apply what I learned at the POKéMON\l TRAINER'S SCHOOL in battle.\p Would you kindly demonstrate how you battle, and with which POKéMON?$ So… I lost…\p It seems that I still have much more to learn…\p I understand.\p The POKéMON LEAGUE's rules state that TRAINERS are to be given this\l if they defeat a GYM LEADER.\p Please accept the official POKéMON LEAGUE STONE BADGE.$ {PLAYER} received the STONE BADGE from ROXANNE.$ The STONE BADGE heightens the ATTACK power of your POKéMON.\p It also enables them to use the HM move CUT outside of battle.\p Please take this with you, too.$ That TECHNICAL MACHINE, TM39, contains ROCK TOMB.\p It not only inflicts damage by dropping rocks, it also lowers SPEED.\p If you use a TM, it instantly teaches the move to a POKéMON.\p Remember, a TM can be used only once, so think before you use it.$ Since you are so strong, you should challenge other GYM LEADERS.\p By battling many TRAINERS, you should learn many things.$ RUSTBORO CITY POKéMON GYM$ RUSTBORO CITY POKéMON GYM\p ROXANNE'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS: {PLAYER}$ … … … … … … … … … … … Beep!\p ROXANNE: Oh, hello, {PLAYER}? This is ROXANNE of RUSTBORO CITY.\p I heard from BRAWLY that you're moving up through the ranks of\l TRAINERS at an incredible clip.\p Well, I'd rather not think that I can't beat you.\p I promise, I will shape up my GYM so that you may challenge us again.\p I hope you'll be looking forward to that occasion as much as me!\p … … … … … … … … … … … Click!$ Registered GYM LEADER ROXANNE in the POKéNAV.$ ROXANNE: I'm so glad to see you again. I'm ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER here.\p I'm sure we've both experienced many battles since we last met.\p I would like to see how much better we've become. Let us battle!$ Grr… Again, I have lost…$ ROXANNE: I still have much to learn when it comes to battling POKéMON.\p That awareness makes me love battling all that much more!$ ROXANNE: I'm so glad to see you again. I'm ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER here.\p I'm sure we've both experienced many battles since we last met.\p I would like to see how much better we've become…\p Oh, no… You only have one POKéMON with you?\p Please return with at least one more POKéMON.")
