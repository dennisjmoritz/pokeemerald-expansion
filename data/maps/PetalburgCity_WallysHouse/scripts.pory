Where's WALLY? He's already left, our WALLY.\p I wonder where he could have gotten by now?$ I wonder how our WALLY is doing?$ {PLAYER}{KUN}! Please excuse us for dragging you here this way.\p But our WALLY's become very healthy since he went to VERDANTURF TOWN.\p We owe it all to you!\p When WALLY left town, you helped him catch a POKéMON, right?\p I think that made WALLY really happy.\p Actually, not just WALLY. It made me, his father, happy too.\p Happy that he's gained such a great friend as you.\p This isn't a bribe or anything, but I'd really like you to have this.$ If your POKéMON can SURF, you'll be able to go to all sorts of places.$ WALLY's coming home soon. I'm looking forward to that.$ Oh? You met WALLY in EVER GRANDE CITY?\p Oh, {PLAYER}{KUN}, don't be silly.\p He may have gotten healthy, but he can't go somewhere far away like\l that all by himself.$ WALLY was really happy when he told us that he caught a POKéMON.\p It's been ages since I've seen him smile like that.$ I want you to keep this a secret from my husband…\p But our WALLY left VERDANTURF TOWN without telling anyone.\p You know, WALLY is frail, but he's surprisingly strong-willed.\p I'm sure that he'll come back safe and sound one day!")
