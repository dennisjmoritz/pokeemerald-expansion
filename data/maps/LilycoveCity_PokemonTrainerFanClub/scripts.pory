    format("Oh, wow! It's {PLAYER}!$ I've heard the news! You're really strong, aren't you?\p We always argue about who is the strongest of all TRAINERS here.\p So when I heard about you, I decided to be your fan!\p I hope you'll keep on battling other tough TRAINERS.\p That way, we'll be able to see more of your hot, hot battles.\p That will make the others here see exactly how great you are.\p Remember, I'm cheering for you, {PLAYER}!$ Yo, {PLAYER}! You're the one we want to win!$ The others, they don't know that you're the best of the best!\p Isn't that right, {PLAYER}? Show them you've got guts!$ I hate to say this, but the TRAINER everybody's talking about is\l {STR_VAR_1}, no question about it!\p That TRAINER's power… It's out of the ordinary.$ Darn it… I've been telling people that {STR_VAR_1} is the best now…\p But no one wants to listen…$ I've been hearing things about a tough new TRAINER.\p This TRAINER's supposed to be beating GYM LEADERS, even.\p Do you know anything about this new TRAINER?$ Oh! {PLAYER}!\p Go for it! I'm pulling for you!$ Sigh… BRAWLY…\p Oh, no! Wait! That's not right! No, no, no!\p I'm your fan through and through!\p So make me proud! Go for it!$ I can't help it, I can only get to like BRAWLY…$ Nobody understands the charm of BRAWLY…\p I don't care!\p Even if I'm the only one, I'm going to keep cheering for BRAWLY!$ Whatever anyone says, my favorite TRAINER is DEWFORD's GYM LEADER\l BRAWLY!$ You've surpassed your own father in every regard!\p I'm telling you, so there's no question about it at all!$ Even when things turned bleak, your father never gave up.\p This I know to be true.\p You never give up even if you lose! So keep on battling!$ NORMAN battled with more power, charisma, and showmanship than you.\p Even though people may say that you're strong…\p You've still got a long way to go compared to your father.$ You're beginning to get the same air of awe NORMAN exudes.\p But there's something conclusively different between you and NORMAN.\p I can't tell you what that is. You'll have to find it yourself.$ Everyone here, we're all huge fans of POKéMON battles.\p We discuss who we consider to be the strongest of all TRAINERS.\p If you were to become famous, we might even become your fans!$ Oh, woweee! It's {PLAYER}! For real, too!\p Please, shake my hand, shake my hand!$ I'll always cheer for you, {PLAYER}! Always, always!\p I don't want to see you lose ever, {PLAYER}.\p Because I know you're really, really strong, {PLAYER}!$ {STR_VAR_1} is really cool…\p Everyone thinks so, right, right?$ {STR_VAR_1} really is cool, don't you think so?\p Even if it's just me, I'm going to keep cheering my favorite TRAINER.$ My favorite TRAINER is…\p Cool…\p Strong…\p And really nice…\p I wish there was a TRAINER like that…$ Whoa! It's {PLAYER}! Wicked!\p When I grow up, I want to be strong like you, {PLAYER}!$ Even if I'm the only one…\p You'll always be the only one I cheer for, {PLAYER}!\p Because I believe in you, {PLAYER}!$ {STR_VAR_1} is so wickedly cool… I want to shake hands with my hero.$ Even if I'm the only one…\p I'm never going to stop being {STR_VAR_1}'s fan!\p Because I've heard, {STR_VAR_1} never loses!$ {PLAYER}! You are amazing after all!\p Ever since I set eyes on you, I knew that you were great.\p It looks like my eyes didn't deceive me.$ Who cares about the others. I'm in your corner!\p You don't need to worry. Just get out there and battle like always.$ You're a pretty decent TRAINER, I think.\p But I also think that {STR_VAR_1} is number one right now.\p That's just my opinion. Don't worry about it too much.$ Wow, you really are strong. Maybe even stronger than {STR_VAR_1}.\p But {STR_VAR_1} needs me.\p If I don't cheer for {STR_VAR_1}, who will?$ You've changed my mind! You are strong, aren't you?\p I'd like you to tell me how you managed to get so strong!$ The tougher the situation, the more attractively you battle.\p I can't wait for your next battle!$ Among the recently hot TRAINERS, {STR_VAR_1} is the standout.\p That toughness, it's simply not normal.\p You're doing okay, but you're not in the same class as {STR_VAR_1}.$ You are really popular…\p You're strong, and you're caring to POKéMON. No one can knock you.\p But, you know, I believe in {STR_VAR_1}.\p {STR_VAR_1} is definitely stronger! I'm positive!$ You…\p Impressive!$ Your true worth, it is fine if only I recognized it.\p The others I doubt will understand the hidden power that beats within.$ Yes, I see strength in your eyes.\p But!\p You still haven't realized your potential.$ It is true that you are tremendously powerful.\p But! I can tell…\p That strength cannot be considered true strength yet!\p True strength is…! … …\p Actually, I have no idea, either.")
