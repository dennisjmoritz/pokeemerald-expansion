SEA!\p What I love above all is to see hot POKéMON battles.\p Let me see that your heart burns hot!\p If you can defeat all the TRAINERS here, I'll reward your efforts.$ Show me some hot matches!\p I run this SEASHORE HOUSE just for that reason alone!$ You're scorching hot! Those battles blazed!\l I'm more than just satisfied!\p As thanks for showing me your hot streak, I want you to take these.\p It's half a dozen bottles of SODA POP!$ Oh, but hey, your BAG's jammed full. I'll hang on to these for you.$ Want to buy some SODA POP? POKéMON love it!\p Just ¥300 a bottle! Buy some!$ Here you go!$ You don't have the money.$ No? That's too bad.$ If you're looking for a battle in the SEASHORE HOUSE, you'll find no\l hotter TRAINER than me, matey!$ That was a hot battle! I can accept that loss, matey!$ Whenever I'm in SLATEPORT, I enjoy hot battles and ice-cold SODA POP!$ Boring battles aren't worth the effort.\p Fiery hot battles are what toughen up TRAINERS and POKéMON!$ That's hot!$ Whew, I'm all thirsty. Maybe I'll have a SODA POP.$ I'm going to show you how great my POKéMON are, but don't cry!$ …I lost, but I won't cry…$ If one of my POKéMON knew the move for carrying me across water on its\l back, I could get rid of this inner tube.")
