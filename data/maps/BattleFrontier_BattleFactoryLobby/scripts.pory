You, there!\p Are you thinking that the events here are easy since you don't need to have\l a raised team of POKéMON?\p I wouldn't be too sure about winning that easily.\p If you don't have thorough knowledge about POKéMON and their moves,\l it will be tough to keep winning.$ I swapped for a weak POKéMON… I thought it was a good kind to have…\p They wiped the floor with us…$ Things haven't been going my way at all.\p You need to check your opponent's POKéMON during battle to see if\l they're any good.$ You know how the staff here give you a few hints about your next opponent?\p Well, I'm a full-grown man, but I have trouble figuring out their hints.$ Like, I'm really tough, but I get bored really easily, so I just kept swapping\l and battling over and over.\p So anyway, when I kept entering Battle Swap events, I noticed they\l varied the rental POKéMON.$ The Battle Swap rules are listed.$ Which heading do you want to read?$ In a Battle Swap event, you may use only three POKéMON.\p Whether you are renting or swapping, your team may not have two or more\l of the same POKéMON.$ You may swap POKéMON only with the TRAINER you have just defeated.\p You may swap for only those POKéMON used by the beaten TRAINER.$ After every battle you win, you may swap for one of your defeated\l opponent's POKéMON.\p You will not be able to swap POKéMON with the seventh TRAINER in the event.$ There are two key points to be aware of when swapping POKéMON.\p First, when swapping, you can't check the stats of the POKéMON you are\l about to receive.\p Second, the POKéMON on your team are lined up in sequence, depending on\l the order in which you rented them.\p This sequence remains unchanged even when swaps are made.$ In the Open Level, the rental POKéMON and the opposing TRAINERS' POKéMON\l are all Level 100.")
