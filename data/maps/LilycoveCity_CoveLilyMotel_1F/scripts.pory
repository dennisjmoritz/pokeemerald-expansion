I was too involved in watching TV!\p Since that TEAM AQUA came to town, the tourists have been staying away.$ Hey, down in front! I can't see the TV!$ Amazing! You're telling me a POKéMON found someone's lost item?\p That's something. If we had some smart POKéMON like that…\p We could recover anything that our guests mislaid…$ Oh, sorry, sorry! I was too involved in watching TV!\p I heard that someone busted the TEAM AQUA HIDEOUT.\p Thanks to that, we just booked a reservation from a big group.\p It was a company called… Uh… GAME something…$ Amazing! A house-sitting POKéMON caught a burglar?\p That's something. If we had a tough POKéMON as a security guard…\p We would be able to provide our guests with greater safety.$ Oh, sorry, sorry! I was too involved in watching TV.\p Oh, yes. A big group of guests arrived a little while ago.\p They booked in as GAME FREAK, so I guess they must make games.\p Uh-oh, I'd better get working on their dinner!")
