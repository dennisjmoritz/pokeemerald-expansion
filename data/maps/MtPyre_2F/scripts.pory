    format("Memories of my darling SKITTY… My eyes overflow thinking about it.$ Ooch, ouch… There are holes in the ground here and there.\p I didn't notice and took a tumble from the floor above.$ Hey! Are you searching for POKéMON? You came along after me! You're rude!$ Ayieeeeh! I'm sorry, forgive me, please!$ People don't come here often, so I thought there'd be rare POKéMON.$ LUKE: We're here on a dare.\p Heheh, if I show her how cool I am, she'll fall for me. I know it!\p I know! I'll cream you and show her how cool I am!$ LUKE: Whoopsie!$ LUKE: Well, we lost but that's okay! I'm right here by your side.\l We'll make it through this dare!$ LUKE: If you want to take me on, bring some more POKéMON.\p If you don't, I won't be able to show off to my girl how cool I am!$ DEZ: I came here on a dare with my boyfriend.\p It's really scary, but I'm with my boyfriend. It's okay.\p I know! I'll get my boyfriend to look cool by beating you!$ DEZ: Waaaah! I'm scared!$ DEZ: We're lovey-dovey, so we don't care if we lose!$ DEZ: If you want to challenge us, you should bring at least two POKéMON.\p My boyfriend's strong. Just one POKéMON won't do at all.$ You are an unfamiliar sight… Depart before anything befalls you!$ Hmm… You're durable.$ Our family has been TRAINERS here since my great-grandmother's time…\p It is my duty to protect this mountain…$ Kiyaaaaah! I'm terrified!$ Nooooooo! I lost my wits!$ I get freaked out every time I see anything move…\p I shouldn't have come here to train…")
