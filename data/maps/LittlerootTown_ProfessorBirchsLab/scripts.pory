    format("Hunh? PROF. BIRCH?\p The PROF's away on fieldwork. Ergo, he isn't here.\p Oh, let me explain what fieldwork is.\p It is to study things in the natural environment, like fields and mountains,\l instead of a laboratory.\p The PROF isn't one for doing desk work. He's the type of person who would\l rather go outside and experience\l things than read about them here.$ The PROF isn't one for doing desk work. He's the type of person who would\l rather go outside and experience\l things than read about them here.$ PROF. BIRCH is studying the habitats and distribution of POKéMON.\p The PROF enjoys {RIVAL}'s help, too. There's a lot of love there.$ PROF. BIRCH: So, {PLAYER}{KUN}.\p I've heard so much about you from your father.\p I've heard that you don't have your own POKéMON yet.\p But the way you battled earlier, you pulled it off with aplomb!\p I guess you have your father's blood in your veins after all!\p Oh, yes. As thanks for rescuing me, I'd like you to have the POKéMON you\l used earlier.\p {PLAYER} received the {STR_VAR_1}!$ PROF. BIRCH: While you're at it, why not give a nickname to that {STR_VAR_1}?$ PROF. BIRCH: If you work at POKéMON and gain experience, I think you'll make\l an extremely good TRAINER.\p My kid, {RIVAL}, is also studying POKéMON while helping me out.\p {PLAYER}{KUN}, don't you think it might be a good idea to go see {RIVAL}?$ PROF. BIRCH: Great! {RIVAL} should be happy, too.\p Get {RIVAL} to teach you what it means to be a TRAINER.$ PROF. BIRCH: Oh, don't be that way. You should go meet my kid.$ PROF. BIRCH: {RIVAL}? Gone home, I think.\p Or maybe that kid's scrabbling around in tall grass again somewhere…\p If you or your POKéMON get tired, you should get some rest at home.$ PROF. BIRCH: Oh, hi, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\p I heard you beat {RIVAL} on your first try. That's excellent!\p {RIVAL}'s been helping with my research for a long time.\p {RIVAL} has an extensive history as a TRAINER already.\p Here, {PLAYER}{KUN}, I ordered this for my research, but I think you should have\l this POKéDEX.$ {PLAYER} received the POKéDEX!$ PROF. BIRCH: The POKéDEX is a high-tech tool that automatically makes a record\l of any POKéMON you meet or catch.\p My kid, {RIVAL}, goes everywhere with it.\p Whenever my kid catches a rare POKéMON and records its data in the POKéDEX,\l why, {RIVAL} looks for me while I'm out\l doing fieldwork, and shows me.$ PROF. BIRCH: Countless POKéMON await you!\p Argh, I'm getting the itch to get out and do fieldwork again!$ MAY: Oh, wow, {PLAYER}{KUN}! You got a POKéDEX, too!\p That's great! Just like me! I've got something for you, too!$ MAY: It's fun if you can get a lot of POKéMON!\p I'm going to look all over the place because I want different POKéMON.\p If I find any cute POKéMON, I'll catch them with POKé BALLS!$ Oh? Your BAG's full.$ MAY: I wonder where I should go look for POKéMON next?$ BRENDAN: Huh… So you got a POKéDEX, too.\p Well then, here. I'll give you these.$ BRENDAN: You know it's more fun to have a whole bunch of POKéMON.\p I'm going to explore all over the place to find different POKéMON.\p If I find any cool POKéMON, you bet I'll try to get them with POKé BALLS.$ Hey, your BAG's full.$ BRENDAN: Where should I look for POKéMON next…$ It's a serious-looking machine. The PROF must use this for research.$ It's a PC used for research. Better not mess around with it.$ It's crammed with books on POKéMON.$ It's a book that's too hard to read.$ PROF. BIRCH: Now…\p {PLAYER}{KUN} and {RIVAL}, I've had the two of you help me study POKéMON.\p Thanks to your help, new facts are coming to light.\p It appears that in the HOENN region, there are also POKéMON from other\l regions.\p It goes to show how rich and varied the natural environments of HOENN\l happen to be.\p That's why I think it's necessary for me to upgrade your POKéDEX to\l the NATIONAL Mode.\p Here, let me see your POKéDEX units.$ MAY: Eheheh!\p It's so cool that even my POKéDEX is getting updated!\p It's because you went out and caught so many POKéMON, {PLAYER}{KUN}!$ BRENDAN: I went out all over HOENN and checked out POKéMON.\p You can thank me for getting the NATIONAL Mode POKéDEX.\p Yep, you're lucky, {PLAYER}!$ PROF. BIRCH: Okay, all done!$ {PLAYER}'s POKéDEX was upgraded to the NATIONAL Mode!$ PROF. BIRCH: But listen. You've become the CHAMPION,\l but your POKéMON journey isn't over.\p There is no end to the road that is POKéMON.\p Somewhere, there is a grassy patch that's waiting for you!$ MAY: I think I'll take a short break from fieldwork.\p I think I'll help the PROF here for a while.$ BRENDAN: For the time being, I'm taking a break from fieldwork.\p I'll be helping out the PROF here for a while.$ PROF. BIRCH: Oh, {PLAYER}{KUN}! Let's have a look at your POKéDEX.\p … … … … … … … … … … … …\p Yes, there's no doubt about it.\p You really have completed the HOENN region's POKéDEX.\p That's more than just impressive.\p I have a gift for you.\p Consider it my show of appreciation for the fantastic work you've done.\p My gift is a rare POKéMON only found in another region!\p You can have any one of these three POKéMON!$ PROF. BIRCH: These are rare POKéMON only found in another region!\p You can have any one of these three POKéMON!$ PROF. BIRCH: The FIRE POKéMON CYNDAQUIL caught your eye!\p You're as sharp as ever!\p So the CYNDAQUIL is your choice?$ PROF. BIRCH: The WATER POKéMON TOTODILE is your choice!\p You know how to pick a good one.\p So, you'll take the TOTODILE?$ PROF. BIRCH: The GRASS POKéMON CHIKORITA is your choice!\p You sure know what you're doing.\p So, you'll take the CHIKORITA?$ PROF. BIRCH: Take your time before you decide.\p They're all invaluable POKéMON.$ PROF. BIRCH: I see! You picked a fine POKéMON!$ {PLAYER} received the {STR_VAR_1} from PROF. BIRCH!$ Want to give a nickname to the {STR_VAR_1} you received?$ PROF. BIRCH: Listen, {PLAYER}{KUN}. You've completed the HOENN POKéDEX,\l but your POKéMON journey isn't over.\p There is no end to the road that is POKéMON.\p Somewhere, there is a grassy patch that's waiting for you!$ You received the promised POKéMON. Better leave the others alone.$ Oh, you don't have any room for this POKéMON.$ MAY: {PLAYER}{KUN}, after this… What are you going to do?\p Are you going to keep battling and sharpening your skills?\p Or are you going to try filling the NATIONAL POKéDEX?\p I'm staying here to help the PROF.$ BRENDAN: Rather than collecting POKéMON, I prefer slowly and \l steadily raising the one I chose.$ MAY: Oh, hi, {PLAYER}{KUN}! Have you gone to that place,\l the BATTLE FRONTIER?$ BRENDAN: Hey, {PLAYER}! Have you gone out to that place,\l the BATTLE FRONTIER?$ … … … … … … … … … … … Beep!\p SCOTT: Hi, hi, {PLAYER}! It's me, SCOTT.\p I'm aboard the S.S. TIDAL now. It feels great to be on the sea!\p By the way…\p There's this place that I'd like to invite you to for a visit.\p If you're interested, board a ferry at either SLATEPORT or LILYCOVE.\p I'll fill you in on the details when we meet. I'll be waiting!\p … … … … … … … … … … … Click!")
