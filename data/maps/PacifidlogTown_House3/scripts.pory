I won't accept any less than a real {STR_VAR_1}!$ Oh, so you're not going to go through with this?\p That's cool. I'm not desperate to make a trade or anything.$ I know I could go looking for one on my own, but…\p But I really wanted to get a BAGON that another TRAINER caught…$ Is that a POKéDEX?\p Did you get to meet a lot of different POKéMON?\p I wish I was like you.")
