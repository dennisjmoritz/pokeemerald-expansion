I'm disappointed that I can't see you battle…$ Oh, good, good!\p But my house isn't all that sturdy.\p Could I ask you to keep it down to a 3-on-3 match?$ Before you two battle, you should save your progress.$ I hope to see a good match!$ {STR_VAR_1}$ The match ended up a draw.$ So, it became a standoff.\p It was a brilliant match in which neither side conceded a step!$ {STR_VAR_1}$ That was superlative!\p Why, it was like seeing myself in my youth again!$ {STR_VAR_1}$ Ah, too bad for you!\p But it was a good match. I hope you can win next time.")
