    format("I'll show you the sublime techniques I learned from our LEADER JUAN!$ Please forgive me, JUAN…$ Watch what happens if you crack all the floor tiles.$ You came all the way here, but you won't get to see JUAN.\p Not if you lose to me, you won't!$ You're strong! I was fooled by your cute looks!$ You might be good enough to avoid being wiped out in one hit by JUAN.$ The sight of JUAN conducting a battle…\p The very beauty of it compelled me to become a TRAINER.$ You battled with more beauty than I could muster…$ The grace you bring to battle is fabulous.\p Oh… I'm so fortunate to have found POKéMON.$ I should teach you how harsh battles can be.$ Oh. You're strong.$ I'll tell you something good.\p If you want to reach JUAN, you need to walk on each floor tile once.$ The POKéMON GYM of the highest level in the HOENN region…\p That's the SOOTOPOLIS GYM.$ What a high level you are!$ Rather than being satisfied by being in a strong GYM, I imagine training in\l other places will make you stronger.\l But above all, it looks more fun.$ I train my POKéMON together with JUAN.\p Don't think I'm a pushover.$ I was beaten…$ I think you have potential. Why don't you stay and train with us?$ A graceful glide across the ice while crossing no lines…\p A TRAINER putting on that performance would be elegantly beautiful!$ Well, excuse me?!$ This is really obvious, but how strong you are as a TRAINER has nothing to do\l with how young or old you are.$ When I'm with my POKéMON, the time flies by before you can say, “Oops!”$ Oops!$ I wish I could forget about lost causes before I can manage an “Oops!”$ I can battle with really rare POKéMON if you'd like.$ Oh, there now! Did you have a good look at my POKéMON?$ I came to this GYM because JUAN praised me for my darling POKéMON.\p Oh, if only I'd met JUAN years ago when I was younger…$ Giggle… Your grim look is so charming.$ Oh, dear. I went much too easy on you.$ You couldn't lay a finger on JUAN, I'm sure. Giggle…")
