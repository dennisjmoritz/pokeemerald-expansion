# About This Repository

This repository is a fork of **[pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/)**.

I am trying to set it up so the feature I am using from other and my own implementations are more approachable. I may fail misarably at this..

## Branches of Interest

Hopefully each of these branches can be treated as a freature branch with can be easily merged into a pokeemerald-expansion repo.

- **Four-Region Map Branch** – combines Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh (Currently buggy due to firered script integration) Maps were ported from: [StrangeQuark’s Omnis branch](https://github.com/StrangeQuark/pokeemerald/tree/omnis#) and [LiderMorti00’s Sinnoh expansion](https://github.com/LiderMorti00/Sinnoh-pokeemerald-expansion)  
- **House** - Reimagines secret bases to act more like houses. Adds fuctional decorations.
- **Unbound Quest Menu** - Brings PokemonSanFran's implimentation of the Pokemon Unbound's quest menu up to date with pokeemerald-expansion (most of the work done by lienne for their pokemon starbound project). Will be converting the quest data to a json format. This is not my work,but I want to keep it here for ease of use for people looking to bring the quest menu into pokeemerald-expansion
- **Dex Modules** - Tweaks the ev/iv to be tabs on the summary screen rather than all included on that stats page and allows them to be turned on seperately via in game flags.
- **Level 50** - Sets the game up to run all battles at scaled level 50 and other tweaks to follow a vgs mindset. Double battles.
